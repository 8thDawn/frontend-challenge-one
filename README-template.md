## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Better use of CSS Flexbox and it's properties
- How to tint an image
- The use of @media to ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes


### Useful resources

- (https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background-blend-mode/) - This helped me in tinting the image. I will be looking at how the other options of this property fits with images in general for example when you hover a mouse pointer on an image.
- (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This also helped me to understand the concept of responsiveness of a webpage in the shortest time possible. Please check it out.
